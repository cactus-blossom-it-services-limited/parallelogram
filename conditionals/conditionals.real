# Real programmers use the test builtin command
# which is equivalent to using square brackets for comparison:

# && takes an action if the test is true || if it proves false
test "$($whoami)" != 'root' || (echo you are not using a non-privileged account; exit 1)
&& (echo Great the test proved false;)
# You can change the exit status to another integer e.g. 33
